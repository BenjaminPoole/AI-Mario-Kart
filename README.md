# AI-Mario-Kart
A Convolutional Neural Network that will be able to play Mario Kart Wii. This project is currently in development

So far I've completed data collection by writing a program that can log keystrokes and record a dolphin window. At the moment I'm working on pre-processing data for the Convolutional Neural Network that will drive Mario.
